    "##The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "I generally have a use case for Hadoop in my daily job. It has made my life easier in a sense that I am able to get results which I was not able to see with SQL queries. But still I find it painfully slow. \n",
    "I have to write procedural programs while I work. As in merge these two datasets and then filter and then merge another dataset and then filter using some condition and yada-yada. \n",
    "You get the gist. And in hadoop its painstakingly boring to do this. You have to write more than maybe 3 Mapreduce Jobs. One job will read the data line by line and write to the disk. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of data movement that happens in between that further affects the speed.\n",
    "Another thing I hate is that there is no straight way to pass files to mappers and reducers and that generally adds up another mapreduce job to the whole sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that is just procedural tasks. To implement an iterative algorithm even after geting the whole logic of parallelization is again a challenge. There would be a lot of mapreduce tasks, a shell based driver program and a lot of unique thinking to bring everything together. And the running times are like crazy. I am like \n",
    "\n",
    "    \"It is ok if you want me to create the code, but please don't ask me to run it\".\n",
    "\n",
    "That makes me think about the whole way Hadoop is implemented. While at the time Hadoop appeared the RAM was costly. \n",
    "Now that is not the case. We already have 64GB machines in our Hadoop cluster. So is it really a good idea to not use a larger chunk of memory and read line by line. \n",
    "Also can we have something that allows us to keep a particular piece of data in the memory, So that the next time our program needs it it doesnt have to read it again and waste time. \n",
    "Wouldnt it be better if we have some variable that lets us keep the state our iterative algorithm is in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "And here is where Spark comes to rescue. Now working on Spark is very different from Hadoop but when you start using it you find that it makes things so much easier. You still do have to think in the mapreduce way sort of but the way the map and reduce steps are done are a little bit different. \n",
    "\n",
    "So lets first get Spark on our System (But keep in mind that for running spark in production environments you will\n",
